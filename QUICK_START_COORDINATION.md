# Quick Start: Instance Coordination

**TL;DR**: 4 Claude instances working on platform consolidation. All ready to commit. Read this first.

---

## 🎯 What Just Happened

The main analysis instance has:
1. ✅ Pulled latest changes from all 4 repositories
2. ✅ Analyzed dependencies and integration points
3. ✅ Created coherence plan for platform consolidation
4. ✅ Prepared commit messages for all instances

**Your next action**: Read your instance-specific section below, then commit and push.

## 📋 Instance Quick Reference

### Are you working on LangGraph?
**Location**: `/workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-langgraph`
**Your work**: Narrative intelligence library with NCP support
**Status**: ✅ Complete - ready to commit
**Commit message**: See CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md → Instance 1
**Next steps**: Create NCP integration examples

### Are you working on LangChain?
**Location**: `/workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-langchain`
**Your work**: Langfuse tracing integration
**Status**: ✅ Complete - ready to commit
**Commit message**: See CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md → Instance 2
**Next steps**: Extract Langfuse utilities to shared package

### Are you working on ava-langflow?
**Location**: `/workspace/ava-langflow`
**Your work**: Universal multi-backend platform v2.0.0
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY - ready to commit
**Commit message**: See CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md → Instance 3
**Next steps**: Integrate shared Langfuse utilities (wait for Instance 2)

### Are you working on ava-Flowise?
**Location**: `/workspace/ava-Flowise/src/agentic_flywheel`
**Your work**: Domain specialization and intent classification
**Status**: ✅ Complete - ready to commit
**Commit message**: See CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md → Instance 4
**Next steps**: Align Redis schema with ava-langflow

## 🚀 Your 3-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Read Your Details
Open `CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md` and find your instance section (1-4)

### Step 2: Commit & Push
Use the suggested commit message from the coordination doc
```bash
# Example for Instance 1
cd /workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-langgraph
git add libs/narrative-intelligence/
git commit -m "[see coordination doc for full message]"
git push origin [your-branch-name]
```

### Step 3: Update Status
After pushing, update `INSTANCE_STATUS.md`:
- Mark your checkpoint as complete
- Add any notes about your work
- Flag any blockers you encountered

## 📊 Current Platform State

```
langchain (ROOT)
├── ✅ Langfuse integration complete
└── langgraph
    ├── ✅ Narrative intelligence added
    ├── ava-langflow
    │   └── ✅ Multi-backend v2.0.0 (18 tools, 141 tests)
    └── ava-Flowise
        └── ✅ Domain specialization complete
```

**All green** ✅ - Ready for next phase!

## 🔗 Integration Roadmap

### This Week
1. All instances commit current work
2. Instance 2 extracts shared Langfuse utilities
3. Instances 3 & 4 document Redis schemas

### Next Week
1. Standardize Redis across platforms
2. Integrate shared Langfuse utilities
3. Create cross-platform integration tests

### Next Month
1. Evaluate backend consolidation
2. Integrate narrative intelligence with flow platforms
3. Unified platform documentation

## ⚠️ Important Coordination Points

### Don't Wait For:
- Committing your current work (all instances ready now)
- Pushing to your branch (no conflicts expected)
- Documenting your achievements

### Do Wait For:
- **Instances 3 & 4**: Wait for Instance 2's shared Langfuse utilities before integrating
- **Backend consolidation**: Wait for architectural decision before major changes
- **Shared Redis schema**: Coordinate between Instances 3 & 4

### Communicate About:
- Blockers or dependencies on other instances
- Changes that affect shared files
- Discoveries that impact other instances' work

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Which branch should I push to?**
A: Your current branch (check `git branch` or see Instance sections in coordination doc)

**Q: Can I commit now or should I wait?**
A: ✅ Commit now! All instances are ready and on separate branches

**Q: What if I encounter merge conflicts?**
A: You shouldn't - each instance is on a separate branch. If you do, document in INSTANCE_STATUS.md

**Q: Should I create pull requests?**
A: Not yet - push to your branch first, PRs will be coordinated later

**Q: What if my work isn't ready?**
A: Update INSTANCE_STATUS.md with your current status and ETA

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before moving to next phase, ensure:

- [ ] Read CROSS_INSTANCE_COORDINATION.md for your instance
- [ ] Reviewed suggested commit message
- [ ] Committed all your changes
- [ ] Pushed to your branch
- [ ] Updated INSTANCE_STATUS.md
- [ ] Checked for any blockers affecting other instances
- [ ] Documented next steps in status board

## 🎯 What Makes This Work

**Parallel Development**: 4 instances working independently on separate concerns
**Clear Ownership**: Each instance owns a specific repository/component
**Coordination Protocol**: Shared status files prevent conflicts
**Integration Points**: Well-defined handoffs between instances
**Shared Vision**: Single unified platform as end goal

---

**Remember**: You're part of a coordinated multi-instance effort. Your work enables the others!

**Current Phase**: ✅ Individual commits → 🔄 Shared utilities → 🎯 Integration → 🚀 Consolidation

**Your next action**: Commit and push, then update status board.
