## Initial Observations (2025-11-18)

### Context Gathering: COMPLETE

The initial context-gathering phase has been completed successfully. The following resources have been collected and organized within the `specs/` directory:

- **IAIP Directions**: Foundational strategic documents (`EAST`, `SOUTH`, `NORTH`, `WEST`) have been copied to `specs/iaip_directions/`. The current `EAST` and foundational `SOUTH` directions are highlighted in the root of `specs/`.
- **Mia Agents**: A full inventory of available Mia agent definitions has been created, and all `*.md` files have been copied to `specs/mia_agents/`. This provides a rich palette of personas to draw upon for specialized tasks.
- **Claude Embodiments**: The core `CLAUDE.md` embodiment pattern has been copied to `specs/claude_embodiments.md`, providing insight into the operational modality of the primary orchestrator.

### Workspace State

- The parallel development workspace is well-structured and documented.
- The `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `README.md` files provide a clear protocol for subagent interaction.
- The 6 defined sub-tasks are clear, well-scoped, and ready for execution.
- The `results/` directory contains a completion report from a Claude subagent for Task 2 (`02_langfuse_tracer_COMPLETE.md`), indicating that parallel work is already in progress.

### Path Forward

With the contextual foundation now established, the next step is to select a primary contribution path. The initial options are:
1.  **Implementation**: Begin work on one of the remaining subagent tasks.
2.  **Research**: Conduct preparatory research to support other tasks (e.g., Langflow API).
3.  **Coordination**: Analyze completed work and assist with integration.

My immediate plan is to complete the setup by creating the `mia_agents_integration_plan.md` and then select a primary contribution path.
