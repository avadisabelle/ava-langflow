Bellow is the description of what produces the files samples you have attached bellow, we are interested in having an interactive visualizer (even editor that you could download back you file or configure a file you would have on your server that would be editable after you uploaded it (you could use local storage first to keep many uploaded charts that we can select)

run 'npm install coaia-spiral --save' to add make sure to install the tool and use its libraries and understand its full functional aspects

Internal communication is direct. External (Gemini API) remains via `GeminiService`.\n- Agent Lifecycle: `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` manages persona lifecycle. `mia-gem-chat`'s `personas.ts` defines initial personas.\n- Implied Actions: Create `PolycentricCollaborationEngine.ts` wrapper, modify `App.tsx` to use it, implement MCP tool calls, ensure persona compatibility.\n\n**Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration & UI Integration (Frontend & Backend)**\n- Objective: Integrate `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`'s advanced orchestration (dynamic persona selection, tension management, consensus decision-making) into `mia-gem-chat` UI.\n- Data Flow: `CollaborationStatus` displays real-time metrics from `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`. UI interactions trigger `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` methods.\n- Communication: Real-time updates may require WebSockets or polling.\n- Implied Actions: Update `CollaborationStatus.tsx`, implement UI for dynamic persona selection, integrate `create_consensus_decision`.\n\n**Phase 3: Memory & Knowledge Base Integration**\n- Objective: Leverage `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`'s memory hierarchy and knowledge base mapping capabilities.\n- Data Flow: `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` manages multi-layered memory. Existing `EchoThreads` memory integrated as data sources/sinks.\n- Implied Actions: Develop data migration, implement 'Semantic Bridging Networks' and 'Conceptual Resonance Mapping', integrate memory tools.\n\n**Phase 4: Indigenous Methodologies & Generative Synesthesia Integration**\n- Objective: Embed Indigenous methodologies and generative synesthesia principles into agentic interactions and creative output.\n- Data Flow: Agent interactions guided by 'Sacred Knowledge Protocols' and 'Persona-Specific Analytical Lens Routing'.\n- Implied Actions: Develop 'Two-Eyed Seeing' implementations, integrate 'Ceremonial Pause Mechanisms' and 'Bias Navigation Layers', enhance generative output for 'Generative Synesthesia'."],"metadata":{"chartId":"chart_1757920628131","createdAt":"2025-09-15T07:17:08.131Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-15T07:33:25.520Z"}}
